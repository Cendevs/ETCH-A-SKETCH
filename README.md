Displaying my DOM manipulation skills. I built  this browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch via the Odin project.

On the click of the 'create new grid' a window prompt pop a button to the top of the screen which  the current grid  will clear and a popup send to the user asking for how many squares per side to make the new grid. Once entered the new grid should be generated without changing the total amount of pixels used.

There is also random color button which once click you be able to make trails with random colors
